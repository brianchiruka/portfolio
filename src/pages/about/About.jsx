          My name is Brian, and I am a junior Web developer and Visual Designer
          based in JHB, ZA. My technical experience started with me fiddling
          with breadboards and microprocessors to do things like control üí°
          <b>LEDs and light sensorsüí°.</b> Introducing me to writing code in C
          and Assembly and eventually studying ‚ö°
          <b>Electrical Engineering at CUT‚ö°.</b>

        <Typography variant="body1">
          I combine research, user flows, and visual design & development to
          transform tricky problems into engaging solutions. With a background
          in computing achitecture, I understand the constraints of the web and
          am able to build around them effectively.

          What am I passionate about?

        <Typography variant="body1">
          I believe that lowering the barrier of entry into development will
          empower more people to create ‚ú®<b>beautiful experiences</b>‚ú®. But
          more importantly, I love working with diverse people who want to make
          the üåé a little better.
