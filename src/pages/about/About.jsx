        My name is Marco Cornacchia, and I am a Product Designer and Visual
        Developer based in NY. I have a B.A. in Psychology, a M.S. in
        Information Design and a background in Front-End Development.

      <Typography variant="body1">
        I combine research, user flows, wireframing, prototyping, storytelling,
        and visual design & development to transform tricky problems into
        engaging solutions. With a background in Front-End Development, I
        understand the constraints of the web and am able to design and build
        around them effectively.

        What am I passionate about?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        As a No-Code enthusiast, I believe that lowering the barrier of entry
        into development will empower more people to create ‚ú®beautiful
        experiences‚ú®
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Because of this, I am always on the lookout for No-Code solutions (like
        Webflow‚Äîwhich this site is entirely built on) that help everyone work
        faster and place the focus on the design, accessibility, and execution
        of products. I am also extremely passionate about bridging the gap
        between designers & developers in order to create the best possible
        products.

      <Typography variant="body1">
        But most importantly, I love working with diverse people who want to
        make the üåé a little better before we‚Äôre all DEAD üíÄ Okay, what else? I
