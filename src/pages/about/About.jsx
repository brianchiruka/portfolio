          My name is Brian Chiruka, and I am a Web developer and Visual Designer
          based in JHB, ZA. My technical experience started with with me
          fiddling with breadboards and microprocessors to create logic circuits
          using C and Assembly. My professional background is an equal split
          between tech and client experience on commercial services.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          I combine research, user flows, wireframing, prototyping,
          storytelling, and visual design & development to transform tricky
          problems into engaging solutions. With a background in Front-End
          Development, I understand the constraints of the web and am able to
          design and build around them effectively.

          I believe that lowering the barrier of entry into development will
          empower more people to create ‚ú®beautiful experiences‚ú®

        <Typography variant="body1">
          Because of this, I am always on the lookout for No-Code solutions that
          help everyone work faster and place the focus on the design,
          accessibility, and execution of products. I am also extremely
          passionate about bridging the gap between designers & developers in
          order to create the best possible products.
