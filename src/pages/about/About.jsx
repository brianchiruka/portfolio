          My name is Brian Chiruka, and I am a junior Web developer and Visual
          Designer based in JHB, ZA. My technical experience started with me
          using breadboards and microprocessors to do things like control LEDs
          and sensors. This introduced me to writing code in C and Assembly and
          eventually studying Electrical Engineering at CUT. After university I
          then went on to get professional experience as a technician and roles
          that focused on client experience for commercial services

          I combine research, user flows, wireframing, prototyping,
          storytelling, and visual design & development to transform tricky

          achitecture, I understand the constraints of the web and am able to
          build around them effectively.
